Extra Features:
	This interface has an additional feature to select from five possible Bible versions.

Request Pipe Format:
	"<version> <request> <book>:<chapter>:<verse>"
	Where version is a bible version identifier,
	request is one of {lookup, next, prev},
	and the book, chapter, and verse are decimal-ascii integers.

Reply Pipe Format:
	"<status> [<book>:<chapter>:<verse>] [<verse text>]"
	Where status is a decimal-ascii integer LookupResult (the rest of the reply is only valid if status == SUCCESS),
	the book, chapter, and verse are decimal-ascii integers,
	and the verse text is an indefinite string representing the verse if the request was "lookup".
